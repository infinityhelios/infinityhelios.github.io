<h1>Drag-On Dragoon 1.3</h1>
<p>Or, Drakengard 1.3, DOD1.3, whatever.
<br><br>
A year after Drakengard 3's initial Japanese release, it saw its main Materials artbook come out featuring concept art, explaining game lore and exclusive lore included in it. One of the exclusive lore to it was Drag-on Dragoon 1.3, a novella written by Yoko Taro, Eishima Jun, Kikuchi Hana, Matsuhita Ayaki and Natori Sawako. 

<br><br>
It's the story of Drakengard in Drakengard 3's A branch, taking place after the events of Drakengard: Shi Ni Itaru Aka. Although, knowledge of what happens in SNIA isn't required to enjoy the story of DOD1.3.
<br><br>
In branch A of Drakengard 3, pacts aren't established due to Zero's early death. Caim is able to talk the entire story, and his bond with Angelus is very different. The other characters also find themselves in different situations than what entailed in the original Drakengard, and do not have their original pact partners but rather reside with other dragons instead. Furiae also has a dragon.
<br><br>
Additionally, it's stated in the Outline that the concept of dod1.3 was created as a remake pitch for Drakengard during the development of Drakengard 3. It was turned down, so the concepts remain in the form of the official novella. You would probably see the ideas of 1.3 in a Drakengard remake, if one was ever greenlit.

<p>The Outline features a Branch timeline for DOD1.3, but the story only goes to Ending A. All the other endings are completely unexplained and we will never know what they are. It would be interesting to see their ideas. The rest of the outline goes into small character bios for each of the Drakengard characters, comparing their stories from Drakengard and DOD1.3. <b>You can view the translations for them, along with the rest of the outline <a href="https://accords-library.com/contents/dod1-3-a-0000-outline#drag-on-dragoon-13---outline">here.</a></b>
