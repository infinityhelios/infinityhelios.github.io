              Any creature that enters the Seeds is reborn as a monster created for the purpose of eradicating humanity, but the Gods plans go off course when Inuart, and the Goddess, Furiae, enters the Seed. The being that had been created as a result of this is Nowe, an incredibly double-edged being who carries the potential to either destroy humanity, or choose another alternative.

Verdelet forms the Knights of the Seal. It’s original purpose is to guard the Seals, protect the priests, and provide research into the Seals.

Research is started into the undulation of the Great Time.

The Promised Land is discovered. The Promised Land is a dimensional singularity, an umbilical cord, an access point for divine power. There are no Seeds in the Promised Land.
<br><br>
The Castle of the Goddess is designated as the Holy Land, and deemed an inviolable area.

The Sealing Plan is put into operation. Because they could no longer manage the Goddess like they used to, a plan was set in place to prevent the dragon from breaking the seal by creating a man-made, artificial seal to lock it from the outside and therefore strengthen it’s power. 
<br><br>
An attempt is made to utilise the waves of the Great Time. The placement of Crystals in the Promised Land begins, and start to be placed surrounding the Promised Land. Crystals are converters for the waves of the Great Time. Airships and other motive powers use the power that flows from these crystals. 
<br><br>
The plan to spiritually restrain Angelus and steal her freedom is put into motion, separating and binding her soul. The constrained senses and locations are not synchronised together, and so each sense is freed in the following order regardless of which location it was released from: Hearing, speech, sight, figure, and movement.
<br><br>
In order to establish districts placed under their direct control, the Knights of the Seal begin to govern neighbouring countries. <br><br>
          </td>
          <td>
The immense agony Angelus felt from the Sealing Plan’s separation of her soul reaches Caim, after which all contact between the two is lost.
<br><br>
Manah (12 years old) escapes from Caim. While on the run, she loses her memory, and is taken in by an ex-Imperial village (Manah is not recognised as Priestess since the villagers had recovered from the Red Eye Disease. No one had seen her to begin with.). She learned the hard truth as she saw the oppression of the people within the village. There, she is brought up by a mage who teaches her necessary life skills and magic. Afterwards, they act together until she is about 20 years old.
<br><br>
Caim embarks on an aimless journey in search of Angelus.
<br><br>
Seere (12 Years old) becomes a priest. 
<br><br>
Gismor (37 Years old), who was in charge of the District of Heavenly Time, forms a pact. He becomes the first Guardian of the Key (Verdelet’s dogmatic precedence had left Oror unaware of how the Seal system relied on those who had entered into a pact). Due to this achievement, he became General Gismor.

          The separation of Angelus’ soul is completed. Districts placed under direct control of the Knights are created as a kind of vein for the spiritual energy that is stored within each one. The Forgotten Ruins are located within the District of Hallowed Water, and the ruins in other districts, such as the District of Soul Flame are connected with this.
