        <p>I'm infinityhelios, and I'm here to provide archival of Drakengard content, very strictly Drakengard 1 and Drakengard 2, because I don't currently own any Drakengard 3 stuff to upload. You can find NieR series archival on Accord's Library (the other site that I work on).

          You can navigate the sidebar to view the content you want, what's listed is what I currently can provide.
