<h1>Drag-On Dragoon 2 Web Material</h1>
        <p>
          Web Material was a CD given out during prerelease promotional events for Drakengard 2 in a first-come first serve basis in limited quantities. It was also used for promotional material by representitives. That being said, I was very lucky to be able to obtain it awhile back, one of my favourite pieces in my collection.

          Anyways, its content is slightly underwhelming compared to what you can find in the artbooks, but it is interesting. It contains 3 trailers, pages for the characters (excluding Caim and Angelus for some reason), and information about the gameplay.
          <br><br>
          The screenshots it includes are very crisp though, see here:

          <br><br>
          It also has screenshots of the FMV's and they also look great:

          <br><br>
          It has images of the character's main weapon model:<br><br>

          <br><br>
          I've never seen images like these elsewhere.
          <br><br>
          There's also concept art and main artworks that are in the various artbooks, so nothing special there.
          <br>
          <br>
          It included some trailers that I've uploaded to YouTube, see here:

          All in all it's a very interesting piece of Drakengard media, and I also ripped the contents, you can download it <a href="https://mega.nz/folder/ZeRj3Iya#veADBaPYSAoPW1Xjv8BKbw">here</a>. The readme's are in Japanese, but basically it doesn't work very well without Internet Explorer 6. Without it the links won't work and it won't really work as the program it's intnded to be, but all the files are in the dump either way. I will test it on my Windows XP laptop eventually.
