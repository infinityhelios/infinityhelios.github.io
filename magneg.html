        <h1>Drag-On Dragoon Magnitude "Negative"</h1>
<p>Magnitude "Negative" is a novelization of Drakengard following its D branch that released a couple months after the game. It was written by Aizawa Tadashi. It has artwork and an included poster illustrated by TASA. It contains a new character not in the original game, exclusive scenes and some divergences from the original story.
<br>
<br>
There has never been any official confirmation where this novel fits into the branches of Drakengard and NieR. Personally, I would consider the novel a separate branch due to its major differences from the original Drakengard Branch D, despite it's similarities. 
<br>
<br>
As of November 2022, it is currently in the process of being translated into English by Barnabism. Until it is translated, this is all I can explain about it until I can read it.

A translation of the blurb of the novel by Barnabism:
<br><br></p>
<i><p style="font-family:Times New Roman">The Empire, a force in conquest of the destruction and rebirth of the world... And the "Anti-Imperial Union of Nations" that had formed to end it. The world is trapped in the midst of a final battle over Furiae, a key figure in maintaining the very order of the Earth. After her older brother, Caim, is left seriously injured in the wake of the battle at the Castle of the Goddess, a deal was formed with a dying red dragon, and so he had become a bearer of the pact! With great power now at his disposal, Caim swings his sword with a flaming urge to kill all in his path... A fire that consumes even himself.
<br><br>
Based on the popular action RPG, a novelisation with a refreshing look into a unique fantasy world and the relationships between humans caught in a swirl of both love and hate!</i></p>

Also, on page 299, there is a small illustration of The Little Hero, the protagonist of the story Seere tells before he flies onto Mother Beast. The game had a very artistic interpritation of the character, but this one is very clear.
